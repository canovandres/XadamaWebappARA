Description
We’ve decided to create an Wep Application based on an amusement park. It will offer different festivals and events depending on the season of the year.

Public part
•	General park information:the history of the park, statistics about the number of visitors, photos of the facilities and its location will be shown.
•	Ride: List of the rides with picture, descriptions, minimum height.
•	Restaurant:  List of restaurants, menus of each restaurant and location in the park.
•	Merchandising:  List of the shops and products, with information of the location and prices.
•	Accommodation: List of hotels, type of board (full board, half board) and prices for each one and types of room (suite, double, individual, familiar)
•	Events: type of events (concerts, shows, parades) and its dates and prices.
•	Theme: there will be different themes depending on popular festive days (Halloween, Christmas, Valentine’s day, carnival)  
•	Zone: The park will be divided into different zones, each zone will represent a different continent (Oceania, America etc.)
•	Bus:  In the park, there would be a bus which will go around the park and the hotel area, the client would see in the public part its prices and bus stops.
